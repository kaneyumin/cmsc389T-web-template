                    <p>This project required me to identify a problem that I could observe in my community and try to brainstorm a solution
					to the problem. For a school project, it was the longest and most indepth that I have finished to this date. It required multiple
					interviews and had to be over 25 pages in its printed form</p>

                    <p>In CMSC330 I had my first experience with functional programming, which was a completely new paradigm for me to get used to.
					 Compared to the "normal" programming that I did with Java, C++, and Python, it required a different way to conceptualize problems and solutions.</p>
